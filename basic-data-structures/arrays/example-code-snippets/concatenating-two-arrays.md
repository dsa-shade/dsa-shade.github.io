## Concatenating Two Arrays

Welcome to the "Array Concatenation" section! ðŸš€ In this guide, we'll explore how to concatenate two arrays. Concatenating arrays is like combining ingredients ðŸ¥£ to create a delicious dish, merging the contents of two arrays into a single, flavorful array!

### Overview

Concatenating arrays involves merging the elements of two arrays to form a new array. This process allows you to combine data from multiple sources, creating a unified dataset for further processing.

### Example

Let's dive into an example to illustrate how to concatenate two arrays:

```python
# Define two arrays
array1 = [1, 2, 3]
array2 = [4, 5, 6]

# Concatenate the two arrays
concatenated_array = array1 + array2

# Print the concatenated array
print("Concatenated array:", concatenated_array)
```

### Conclusion

Concatenating arrays is a versatile operation that enables you to merge data seamlessly. By mastering array concatenation techniques, you'll be able to combine arrays with ease, unlocking new possibilities for data manipulation and analysis!
